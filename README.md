# Movie_Recommendation_System


Recommender system is a system that seeks to predict or filter preferences according to the user's choice. Recommender systems are utilixed ia a variety of areas 
incluuding movies, music, books, news research articles, search queries, social tags, and products in general. 
Recommender systema produce a list of recommendations in any of the two ways-

COLLABORATIVE FILTERING: Collaborative filtering approaches build a model from the user's past behaviour (i.e items purchased or searched by the user) as well as 
similar decisions made by other users. this model is used to predict items(or ratings for items) that users may have an interest in.

CONTENT-BASED FILTERING: Content-based filtering approaches uses a series of discrete characteristics of an item in order to recommendadditional items with similar 
properties. Content-based filtering methods are totally based on a description of the item and a profile of the user's preferences. It recommends items based on the 
user's past preferences. Let's develop a basic recommendation sysytem using Python and Pandas.

Let's develop a basic recommendation system by suggesting items that are most similar to a particular item, in this case, movies. It just tells what movies/items are 
most similar to the user's movies choice.
